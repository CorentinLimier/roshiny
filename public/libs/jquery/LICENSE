JS Foundation
Intellectual Property Policy
The JS Foundation supports numerous individual projects (each, a “Project” and together, the
“Projects”). Contributions to individual projects are made pursuant to the license applicable to
each such Project (with respect to each Project, the “Applicable License”). The technical
governing body of each Project is free to choose, as its Applicable License with respect to
contributions of code, the Apache License, Version 2.0 (available at
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
If an alternative inbound or outbound license is required for compliance with the license for a
leveraged open source project or is otherwise required to achieve the JS Foundation’s, or an
individual Project’s, objectives, the Board of Directors of the JS Foundation (the “Board”) may
approve the use of an alternative license for inbound or outbound contributions on an exception
basis. Please email legal@js.foundation to obtain exception approval.
The JS Foundation and its Projects seek to integrate and contribute back to other open source
projects within the scope of driving widespread adoption and continued development of key
JavaScript solutions and related technologies. Based on this design goal for the JS Foundation,
the development community will:
• conform to all license requirements of the open source projects leveraged within the
project; and
• operate to maximize opportunities for compatibility with other projects that might be
leveraged in the project.
Except as may be approved by the Board:
• All new code contributions to any Project shall be made under the Applicable License
accompanied by either a JS Foundation CLA Signature available at
https://js.foundation/CLA or a Developers Certificate of Origin (DCO, available at
http://developercertificate.org/).
• All outbound code will be made available under the Applicable License.
• All documentation (including without limitation code that is intended as sample code)
will be contributed to the Project and made available under the Applicable License or, if
approved by the Project, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License or
under CC0.
Furthermore, on notice to the Projects, the Board may adopt and/or modify contribution policies
for the contribution of code to any Project.
The technical governing body of each Project may provide for additional requirements with
respect to contributions.
Except for (a) each member’s commitment to be bound by this Policy with respect to its or its
employees’ authorized contributions to any Project and (b) any applicable contributor license
agreement, if any, no license is granted by the member to its intellectual property, and none shall
be implied by general membership in the JS Foundation.

As adopted by the Board of Directors on October, 17 2016
